_Why you need one and how to build it properly_

## Why even build a HomeLab?

If you are seriously working with modern IT, it is hard to avoid having a HomeLab. Sure, many things can be learned theoretically — in lectures, through tutorials, or very modern: with **AI**. But you only **truly understand** systems once they are running, break down, and you have to fix them yourself.

A HomeLab is the perfect playground for exactly that:

- Testing and segmenting networks
- Experimenting with firewalls like **[OPNsense](https://opnsense.org/)** or pfSense
- Building, tearing down, and rebuilding **Proxmox** VMs and containers (CTs)
- Running self-hosted services like **[Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/)**, **[Dokploy](https://dokploy.com/)**, **Nginx**, **Traefik**, **Docker**, or entire stacks of them

The list is practically endless. There is a huge **self-hosted community** (on Reddit or GitHub) and an incredible amount of **open-source software** just waiting to be hosted by yourself.

Then come the truly interesting parts:  
Setting up your **own Root CA**, understanding **ACME challenges**, and not just using TLS, but actually **understanding** what is happening under the hood. These are things that have been standard for years, yet are rarely questioned or deeply understood.

Identity providers like **[Authentik](https://goauthentik.io/)** or **[Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/)** fit perfectly into this picture — ideal for realistically modeling authentication, SSO, and role-based access control.

### Theory vs. Reality: Zero Trust

During your studies, you often learn early on how important a [Demilitarized Zone](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demilitarized_zone_(computing)>) or a [Zero Trust Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_architecture) is — but how do you actually implement this in practice?

This is exactly where a HomeLab shines.

**Long story short:**  
Anyone who takes modern IT, cloud computing, security, or microservices seriously **needs a HomeLab**.

### Microservices, Self-Hosting, and the Balancing Act

The current trend clearly points toward **microservices**, containers, orchestration, and self-hosted developer tools:

- GitLab
- Docker registries
- Nextcloud
- Internal APIs
- Monitoring & logging

But here comes the catch:

> **How do you balance space, aesthetics, performance, energy efficiency, and storage?**

The honest answer: **It’s complicated.**

Or put differently: you have to make conscious trade-offs.

## The Foundation: Efficient Hardware Instead of Server Monsters

A classic 1U or 2U enterprise server is often a poor fit for a HomeLab: extremely loud, physically large, and power-hungry.

The elegant solution: **Intel N100 / N150 platforms**.

### The Core: Intel N150 (Twin Lake)

The Intel **N150** (successor to the N100) is almost absurdly efficient:

- **4 cores / 4 threads**
- Up to **3.6 GHz**
- **6 MB cache**
- **Only 6 W TDP**

I specifically chose this board:  
👉 [CWWK M8 Mini-ITX mit Intel N150](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0F9TRT965)

It is ideal for 24/7 operation, virtualization, and storage — without feeling guilty about power consumption.  
A big plus is the **10G LAN** and **two M.2 slots** for very fast SSDs. The single DDR5 SO-DIMM slot supports up to **48 GB of RAM**.

### The Case: 19 Inches, but Not Deep

One thing matters a lot for HomeLabs: **depth**.

Typical server cases are often 60–80 cm deep — completely unnecessary if you want to mount:

- Firewalls
- Switches
- Routers
- Patch panels

in a **network rack**.

I chose this case from the Netherlands:  
👉 [MyElectronics 19" 2U Mini-ITX Short Depth](https://www.myelectronics.nl/us/19-inch-2u-mini-itx-case-short-depth.html)

It is perfect for my HomeLab because it is both **aesthetic and practical**.

### Noise: The Most Underestimated Killer Criterion

A HomeLab that sounds like a helicopter on final approach is not fun — especially if it sits in your office.

The answer is a fantastic and reasonably priced company from Austria: **Noctua**.

The case fits exactly:

👉 [3× Noctua NF-A8](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B00NEMG62M)

These fans are:

- Extremely quiet
- High-quality
- Practically inaudible during continuous operation

Once you use them, you never want anything else again.

### Power Supply: Flex-ATX, but Efficient

For the power supply, two things matter: the **Flex-ATX form factor** and **high efficiency**.  
The higher the efficiency, the less heat is generated — and the quieter the fan needs to run.

My choice:  
👉 [FSP Flex Guru 300W Flex-ATX](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B08WQ491BY)

300 W is more than enough, even with multiple HDDs, NVMe drives, and 10 GbE.

## Conclusion

For **around €600**, I built a high-quality server that is perfectly tailored to my requirements.  
A build that **fits into any office** and still looks truly professional.

## Bonus: Cluster Upgrade

The setup is further enhanced by **2× Lenovo ThinkCentre Mini PCs**.  
Combined with Proxmox and Kubernetes, this allows for truly exciting cluster experiments — including high-availability services, load balancing, and realistic production-like scenarios.
